# REIS CT  |  WORK IN PROGRESS

Project By Brandon Yee, Shayaan Siddiqui, and Rohak Gulia 

## Introduction

This is the basis for a game based on the Real Estate market. The goal of this simulation is to create a realistic version of the Real Estate Market in which users can learn to properly invest in Real Estate.

## Features

This game would simulate the real Real Estate market with different properties, costs, rent, and ever-changing prices in each of the locations.

 - **Rent and Costs:** This simulation also uses a calculated rent-based system to allow property owners to earn passive income (similar to how one would in real life).

 - **Properties:** This simulation currently also has 70+ real-world properties with varying prices, dimensions, and values.

 - **Market Variations:** We are able to simulate market volatility with events changing prices both in specific cities and on a national scale.
