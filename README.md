# REIS CT  | **WORK IN PROGRESS**
 Project By Brandon Yee, Shayaan Siddiqui, and Rohak Gulia 

## Introduction

This is the basis for a game based on the Real Estate market. The goal of this simulation is to create a realistic version of the Real Estate Market in which users can learn to properly invest in Real Estate.

## Features

This game would simulate the real Real Estate market with different properties, tenants and ever-changing prices in each of the locations.

 - **Tenants:** This simulation currently has been developed with 60+ tenants looking to live in varying locations, with varying credit scores, and even varying budgets.

 - **Properties:** This simulation currently also has 70+ real-world properties with varying prices, dimensions, and values.

 - **Market Variations:** We are able to simulate market volatility with events changing prices both in specific cities and on a national scale.
